# dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles and stuff for my machine. Use [yadm](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/) to install this stuff:

```
yadm clone https://github.com/arschles/dotfiles.git
```

It has a bootstrap script that switches on `uname` to execute setup for Debian/Ubuntu or OS X.
